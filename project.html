 <h1> My project is to investigate the Economics of Happiness </h1>
<p> I was curious to better understand the Economics of Happiness after spending a year abroad living in Denmark, which consistently ranks in the top 5 in the World Happiness Index.
  The reasons for Denmarks high ranking include good quality of life, trust in institutions and low crime. 
  However, the high antidepressant rate and ghettoisation of areas with high immigrant populations leads me to question how we define a country as "Happy" </p>
  
  <!--Chart 1 -->
 <p> The first graph shows Iceland ranked as one of the top 5 Happiest country in the world in 2021. The second graph paints a different picture - showing that Iceland had the highest antidepressant rate in 2017 compared to the other countries studied by OECD </p>
