 <h1> Understanding Happiness </h1>
<p> I was curious to better understand the Economics of Happiness after spending a year abroad living in Denmark, which consistently ranks in the top 5 in the World Happiness Index. 
  The World Happiness Report was first released in 2012 and ranks countries based on life evaluations from samples of each countries population. </p>

  <!--Chart 3 -->
 <p> This map visualises the happiness scores of different countries in the 2021 Happiness Index. Countries with higher scores are coloured darker. </p>

  <h3> What makes countries happy? </h3>
 <p> An obvious answer is that richer countries will be happier. This could be because people have higher incomes, there is better infrastructure, better resources etc. 
   I regressed happiness against log GDP per capita, using <a class="textLink" href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1XVn-Z4OewZf5TbazZ7hb3uPoaN68Ou3x?usp=sharing"> python </a> </p>
  <p> I used the dataset from the World Happiness Index which has observations  beginning in 2008, meaning there were 1000s of observations used to make the regression. Using OLS
    the relationship was found to be: Happiness=-1.69+0.765(Log GDP per capita). The coefficient suggests a 1% increase in GDP per capita would lead to a 0.765% increase in happiness rating. However,
    results are likely to be biased due to endogeneity issues. It is more useful therefore, to just consider the correlation. </p>
  <p> This graph shows the correlation between Log GDP per capita and Happiness rating, using data from 2008-2020: </p>

      <div class="chart" id="chart6">
      <script>
        var myChart6 = "happinessvsgdp.json";
        vegaEmbed('#chart6', myChart6);
      </script>
  </div>
  </div>
  <p> We can see positive correlation between GDP and happiness, with a R2 of 0.62. </p>
  <!--Chart 1 -->
 <p>The world happiness report bases life evaluations on 6 factors: levels of GDP, life expectancy, generosity, social support, freedom and corruption. 
   This graph shows the extent to which each factor is estimated to contribute to making life evaluations higher in each country than they are in Dystopia, a hypothetical country that has values equal to the worldâ€™s lowest national averages for each of the six factors.

 <div class="container">
  <div class="chart" id="chart1">
      <script>
        var myChart1 = "top5_barchart_new.json";
        vegaEmbed('#chart1', myChart1);
      </script>
  </div>
  </div>
  <p> GDP per capita makes up the biggest identifiable contribution to happiness, but we can see that a large part of happiness is left unexplained by the 6 factors used by the World Happiness Index.
  </p>
  <p> A survey asks people which factos account most for their happiness </p>
      <!--Chart 5 -->
 <div class="container">
  <div class="chart" id="chart5">
      <script>
        var myChart5 = "happiness_survey.json";
        vegaEmbed('#chart5', myChart5);
      </script>
  </div>
  </div>
  
  
  <h3> Looking for other correlations </h3>
  <p> The World Happiness Report ackowledges that there are other factors which affect happiness and are not yet included in the report. They also highlight
    that the variables are intended to illustrate correlation rather than to reflect clean causal estimates. Finding causal estimates of the effect of each factor on happiness would cause significant 
    endogeneity issues. </p>
  <p> I decided to look for evidence of correlation between happiness and other factors excluded in the report. This could  help explain the large unexplained "residual" contribution to countries happiness Firstly, air pollution: </p>

  <p> Seems to be some correlation between lower air pollution and higher happiness score </p>
<p> How about gender equality and happiness? I used the UNDP Global Inequality Index to make this chart: </p>
