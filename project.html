 <h1> My project is to investigate the Economics of Happiness </h1>
<p> I was curious to better understand the Economics of Happiness after spending a year abroad living in Denmark, which consistently ranks in the top 5 in the World Happiness Index.
  The reasons for Denmarks high ranking include good quality of life, trust in institutions and low crime. 
  However, the high antidepressant rate and ghettoisation of areas with high immigrant populations leads me to question how we define a country as "Happy" </p>
