 <h1> Understanding Happiness </h1>
<p> I was curious to better understand the Economics of Happiness after spending a year abroad living in Denmark, which consistently ranks in the top 5 in the World Happiness Index. 
  The World Happiness Report was first released in 2012 and ranks countries based on life evaluations from samples of each countries population. </p>

  <!--Chart 3 -->
 <p> This map visualises the happiness scores of different countries in the 2021 Happiness Index. Countries with higher scores are coloured darker.
   From this we can see that the "Happier" countries are mostly in Europe, particularly Scandinavia </p>
  <div class="chart" id="chart3">
      <script>
        var myChart3 = "happinessmap.json";
        vegaEmbed('#chart3', myChart3);
      </script>
  </div>
  <p> Add python code </p>

  <!--Chart 1 -->
 <p>The world happiness report bases life evaluations on 6 factors: levels of GDP, life expectancy, generosity, social support, freedom and corruption. 
   This graph shows the extent to which each factor is estimated to contribute to making life evaluations higher in each country than they are in Dystopia, a hypothetical country that has values equal to the worldâ€™s lowest national averages for each of the six factors.
 </p>
  <div class="chart" id="chart1">
      <script>
        var myChart1 = "top5_barchart_new.json";
        vegaEmbed('#chart1', myChart1);
      </script>
  </div>
  
  <p> The World Happiness Report however ackowledges that there are likely to be other factors which affect happiness and are not yet included in the report. They also highlight
    that the variables are intended to illustrate correlation rather than to reflect clean causal estimates. Finding causal estimates of the effect of each factor on happiness would cause significant 
    endogeneity issues. </p>
  <p> I decided to look for evidence of correlation between happiness and other factors excluded in the report. Firstly, air pollution: </p>
    <!--Chart 2 -->
  <div class="chart" id="chart2">
      <script>
        var myChart2 = "airpollutionvshappiness.json";
        vegaEmbed('#chart2', myChart2);
      </script>

  <p> <a class="textLink" href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/10mjNBMdNy0zb94knbek2FHo6q6lYDshd?usp=sharing"> python scraping </a> </p>
  <p> Seems to be some correlation between lower air pollution and higher happiness score </p>
